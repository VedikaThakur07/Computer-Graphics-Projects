Interactive 2D Computer Graphics Demos
Tagline: Interactive 2D computer graphics demos (Algorithms, Transformations, Animations) built with HTML, JavaScript, and Canvas.
This repository contains solutions for all 6 programming tasks from a computer graphics assignment (Section B). They are implemented using pure HTML, JavaScript, and the <canvas> API, with Tailwind CSS for styling.
Each .html file is a self-contained program that can be run directly in any modern web browser.
Programs Included (By Question Number)
Part 1: Algorithms
Q2: DDA Line Drawing Algorithm
File: q2_dda_line.html
Implements the DDA algorithm. Takes user input for coordinates and draws a line pixel-by-pixel.
Q3: Bresenham Line Drawing Algorithm
File: q3_bresenham_line.html
Implements Bresenham's integer-only line algorithm for efficient drawing.
Q4: Scan-line Polygon Fill
File: q4_scanline_fill.html
Fills a pre-defined concave polygon using the scan-line fill algorithm.
Part 2: Transformations & Animations
Q1: Interactive 2D Transformations
File: q1_2d_transformations.html
An interactive tool to Translate, Rotate, and Scale a 2D object.
Q5: Moving Car Animation
File: q5_moving_car.html
An animation of a car driving. The car body translates and the wheels rotate.
Q6: Bouncing Ball Animation
File: q6_bouncing_ball.html
A multi-ball physics simulation showing gravity (translation) and bouncing (reflection).
How to Run
No compilation is required:
Download or clone this repository.
Open any .html file (e.g., q1_2d_transformations.html) in a modern web browser (like Chrome or Firefox) by double-clicking it.
Interact with the programs or watch the animations.
Notes
An internet connection is required to load the Tailwind CSS styling from the CDN.
